     * After which Collections.sort will sort the elemnts in the productList.
     * Product needs to implement Comparable, and implement it's compareTo method.
     * Since AudioPlayer and MoviePlayer are subclasses of Product they also need Comparable's method.
     * I have my AP and MP classes call super.compareTo which will call Product's compareTo method which I changed
     * (1/2)/ Product's compareTo method, takes an object and casts as a Product, which I can do because I know a product will be sent to it.
     * (2/3) Since the object is considerd a Product now, i can use it's .getName method and use
     * (3/3) String class's compareTo method to compare the names of two Product's.
     * Product's compareTo will return the result which is either a -1,0 or 1.
     * Thus Collections.sort will use AudioPlayer's and Movieplayer's compareTo Method, and will sort by Names of objects.
     * Lastly there a method to print whats in the arraylist List.
